# Convolutional Neural Network

# Description:
This folder contains the codes of all the assignments taught in the course Convolutional Neural Network offered by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) instructed by Andrew Ng.

# Note for Learners:
These codes are only uploaded for someone who is stuck in the assignments. I recommend everyone to try out by own not just directly copy. Its a great course offered by deeplearning.ai and the assignments are fairly easy to work on. 

# Thank you, DeepLearning.AI:
I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to the team at DeepLearning.AI for creating such an exceptional course on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The content, organization, and clarity of instruction have been invaluable in my journey to understand and apply CNNs effectively.

 Through this course, I've gained a deeper understanding of CNNs and their applications, which has greatly enhanced my skills and confidence.
 I look forward to exploring more of your courses in the future.
